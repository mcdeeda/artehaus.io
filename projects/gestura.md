# Gestura

![3 Black instruments on a dark background](static/media/uploads/all-3_lightbg.jpg "Gestura")

Gestura was my first major student project in industrial design. My intention was to create electronic musical instruments that were more dramatic and gestural than existing options like midi keyboards and beatpads. 

### Gesture Study

To begin the ideation process, I began a practice of tracing the postures and gestures of traditional musicians, abstracting their instruments and inserting my own curves and volumes to see what sort of new forms were possible. Many of these sketches ended up evolving directly into concepts and models. 

### Form Innovation

Refining my concept with sketches and models, the instruments began to take form as a collection of simple, geometric volumes. I developed a shared angle to heighten their visual relationship while allowing for a split between two materials with different tactile properties: anodized aluminum and silicone. 

### Electronics Prototyping

Creating working electronic prototypes added an extra layer of challenge to this project. I ended up working in Processing and Processing.Sound to interpret serial input from Arduino Uno boards inside of the instruments. All code is open-source and [available on my Github](https://github.com/mcdeeda/Gestura).

### Finished Project

Gestura was an amazing learning experience where I navigated through a crash course in mold-making, working with multiple connecting parts and materials, and incorporating electronics into an industrial design project.
