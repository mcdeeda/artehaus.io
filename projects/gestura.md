# Gestura

![3 Black instruments on a dark background](static/media/uploads/all-3_lightbg.jpg "Gestura")

Gestura was my first major student project in industrial design. My intention was to create electronic musical instruments that were more dramatic and gestural than existing options like midi keyboards and beatpads. 

## Gesture Study

To begin the ideation process, I began a practice of tracing the postures and gestures of traditional musicians, abstracting their instruments and inserting my own curves and volumes to see what sort of new forms were possible.

## Form Innovation

Working from the framework of gesture, I began to isolate specific movements and actions that were interesing to me either visually or as a pairing with a specific sound. I began sketching forms that complemented these gestures.

As testing with friends and peers revealed which postures were comfortable and evocative, and which forms were engaging and intuitive to interact with, the shapes as well as the sounds of the instruments began to take form.

Refining my concept with sketches and models, the instruments began to take form as a collection of simple, geometric volumes. I developed a shared angle to heighten their visual relationship while allowing for a split between two materials with different tactile properties: anodized aluminum and silicone. 

## Electronics Prototyping

Creating working electronic prototypes added an extra layer of challenge to this project. I ended up working in Processing and Processing.Sound to interpret serial input from Arduino Uno boards inside of the instruments. All code is open-source and [available on my Github](https://github.com/mcdeeda/Gestura).

## Finished Project

Gestura is an ongoing project that I continue to use as a baseline to explore the relationship between design, gesture, technology, and sound. The original Gestura instruments were designed under the constrant of a formal family of objects, but I plan to continue developing new forms outside of this restriction to see where the path of gesture -> form -> sound takes me.
