# Talkworks

I worked with Talkworks from 2019 to 2021 to create high quality 3D product models and photorealistic renderings for use on e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Target in addition to product compositions, slides, and brand identity content.

My process at Talkworks included extensive competitor research on product features and design trends, creation of product models using MoI (a parametric 3D program analogous to Rhino), creation of render scenes using Cinema 4D and design of product slides in Illustrator.

During 2021 I served in a coordinator position at Talkworks, managing a largely remote, freelance design team to meet tight deadlines on upcoming product batches. I worked with Monday.com and Pageproof to optimize our collaborative workflow and
