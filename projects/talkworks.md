# Talkworks

![3 Black instruments on a dark background](static/media/uploads/all-3_lightbg.jpg "Gestura")

Since 2019 I've worked with cellphone accessory company Talkworks, designing 3D models and render scenes, as well as product compositions & informative digital slides for use on Amazon, Target, and other e-commerce platforms. 

## Product Modeling & Rendering

My most frequent work at Talkworks is the creation of 3D product models and render scenes based on product samples sent to us from our manufacturing providers. In a sort of inversion of the typical industrial design process, I take precise measurements and recreate the already manufactured product in 3D to create high-quality product imagery for e-commerce.

## Form Innovation

Refining my concept with sketches and models, the instruments began to take form as a collection of simple, geometric volumes. I developed a shared angle to heighten their visual relationship while allowing for a split between two materials with different tactile properties: anodized aluminum and silicone. 

## Electronics Prototyping

Creating working electronic prototypes added an extra layer of challenge to this project. I ended up working in Processing and Processing.Sound to interpret serial input from Arduino Uno boards inside of the instruments. All code is open-source and [available on my Github](https://github.com/mcdeeda/Gestura).

## Finished Project

Gestura is an ongoing project and a baseline for me to continue exploring the relationship between design, sound, and gesture.
