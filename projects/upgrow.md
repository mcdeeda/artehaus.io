UpGrow is a modular hydroponic planter designed for urban users. Disappointed with the countertop herb gardens on the market, I designed UpGrow to hang from the wall in a ladder-like chain, providing users with their own scalable herb garden no matter how cramped their environment is.

Competitor analysis revealed that current options in the home herb garden sector are expensive and limited in use; pod systems restrict the vegetables that users can grow and increase cost per yield, and countertop & floorstanding placements take up valuable real estate in a small apartment.

I explored forms that used vertical space in various ways, hanging from the ceiling, under counters, and stacking on top of one another. 

I settled on a stacking form in which a standardized grow medium (mineral wool cubes) sits in plastic net planters, which rest on the lid of a clear reservoir. From here, I tweaked the form of the planter to reduce the amount it jutted out from the wall.

The design of the net planter went through 4 iterations, the first 3 reducing plastic use and the final iteration attempting to create an organic form which complements the winding roots that would be visible through the clear reservoir

The light that hangs over the planter is designed to rest on the taut steel cables without a fastener, and the power cables can, like the planters, be daisy-chained downward towards a power outlet.
