One of my first projects during my MFA at Parsons was Breeze, a collaborative project in which me and my partner, Danyang Cui, worked from the prompt of "Urban Outdoor Furniture for Public Health". Our process led us towards the design of a modular system of inflatable seats which facilitate serendipitous and playful interactions between strangers. 

## Early Concepts

As we explored concepts in the early stages of designing Breeze, we had an interest in game-like interactions that coud be facilitated by large outdoor structures. Things that moved, rolled, could be picked up and put down, and systems of grids were key areas of interest. We worked from existing archetypal games like checkers to imagine how large-scale games with minimal instruction or structure could facilitate public play.

Eventually, we received a strong response for a sketch and model involving the concept of seats with interconnected internal air cavities. By the nature of this design, it would be difficult or impossible to sit alone as it would deflate your seat and inflate those around you, facilitating a feeling of interdependence with strangers in the same environment.

## Design Iteration & Testing

With our central concept ironed out, we began to delegate tasks between the two of us suited to our strengths. Danyang continued conceptual sketching, imagining new forms and contexts in which our interconnected seats could exist, and I worked on functional models using balloons and plumbing valves to test different fluid transfer speeds and seeing how a possible 3+ way system of seats could work.

As the core idea and implementation of Breeze came into focus, we needed to find solutions for smaller, but more difficult problems. Some questions that came up during our critiques were:

Is it impossible for just 1 person to sit?

How do you protect from vandalism or natural damage to the exterior? 

Will they need a foundation built into the ground?

With this, we began to look inside of the seats and develop the core solution to these issues: We decided on a hybrid option of a solid plastic interior, which could be rotationally molded from PP or another plastic. This form would facilitate the flow of air between seats as well as points of interconnection for tubing, while providing a solid base for an individual sitting. As a result, our core concept was softened a bit from hardcore interdependence, to playful interaction.

We settled on a design involving six valves on each seat, allowing for modular configurations of an arbitrary number of seats. Additionally, by using a hollow plastic base, we avoided the need for a concrete foundation as the base could be filled with sand and flipped over for a simple installation. With our new design decisions in mind, we built out our final 3D models and renders.

## Final Models

The final step in developing Breeze before presenting to our peers and professors was creating two models: one high fidelity in appearance and one high-fidelity in functionality. Danyang created a 3D model of a potential configuration for Breeze involving three sizes of seats and we combined the 3D print with laser cut silhouettes of potential users in the park. 

For the functional model, I cut three foam bases on the band saw and attached a thin latex layer using silicone caulk. Connecting the three bases with soft PVC tubing and a three-way plumbing valve, I placed the entire configuration within an acrylic box I made to make the inner workings easily visible.
