One of my first projects during my MFA at Parsons was Breeze, a collaborative project in which me and my partner, Danyang Cui, worked from the prompt of "Urban Outdoor Furniture for Public Health". Our process led us towards the design of a modular system of inflatable seats which facilitate serendipitous and playful interactions between strangers. 

## Early Concepts

As we explored concepts in the early stages of designing Breeze, we had an interest in game-like interactions that coud be facilitated by large outdoor structures. Things that moved, rolled, could be picked up and put down, and systems of grids were key areas of interest. We worked from existing archetypal games like checkers to imagine how large-scale games with minimal instruction or structure could facilitate public play.

Eventually, we received a strong response for a sketch and model involving the concept of seats with interconnected internal air cavities. By the nature of this design, it would be difficult or impossible to sit alone as it would deflate your seat and inflate those around you, facilitating a feeling of interdependence with strangers in the same environment.

## Design Iteration & Testing

We continued to sketch new design concepts, now focusing on the concept of interdependence and interconnectivity. We refined our desired interaction away from strictly game-like interactions, and towards a more general, serendipitous interaction between strangers.
