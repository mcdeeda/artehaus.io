One of my first projects during my MFA at Parsons was Breeze, a collaborative project in which me and my partner, Danyang Cui, worked from the prompt of "Urban Outdoor Furniture for Public Health". Our process led us towards the design of a modular system of inflatable seats which facilitate serendipitous and playful interactions between strangers. 

## Early Concepts

As we explored concepts in the early stages of designing Breeze, we had an interest in game-like interactions that coud be facilitated by large outdoor structures. Things that moved, rolled, could be picked up and put down, and systems of grids were key areas of interest. We worked from existing archetypal games like checkers to imagine how large-scale games with minimal instruction or structure could facilitate public play.

Eventually, we received a strong response for a sketch and model involving the concept of seats with interconnected internal air cavities. By the nature of this design, it would be difficult or impossible to sit alone as it would deflate your seat and inflate those around you, facilitating a feeling of interdependence with strangers in the same environment.

## Design Iteration & Testing

With our central concept ironed out, we began to delegate tasks between the two of us suited to our strengths. Danyang continued conceptual sketching, imagining new forms and contexts in which our interconnected seats could exist, and I worked on functional models using balloons and plumbing valves to test different fluid transfer speeds and seeing how a possible 3+ way system of seats could work.
