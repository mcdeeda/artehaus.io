# Lyle O. Reitzel Gallery

![3 flyers for gallery openings](static/media/uploads/5c1c2b39f3c4a4975bfe173d_woodlandfables_front-p-800.jpg "Opening Flyers")

In addition to co-managing Lyle O. Reitzel Gallery in 2018, I designed all posters, flyers and other graphical assets for the gallery's various events including openings and artist talks.

## The Other Gallery

In January 2019 I had the opportunity to do brand identity and assist in exhibition design for a secondary pop-up gallery, The Other Gallery. Our exhibition, "Without Permission" by Lucinda Grange opened January 21st, 2019 in the Lower East Side.
